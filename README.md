This is a timing-oriented platformer game, with entertaining mechanics such as launch barrels and special collectibles. Each handcrafted level is fun and engaging; they are guaranteed to challenge most players.

Game Refrences: Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario Wii

### Brainstorming
* Tile based level like Mario
* Lives Counter like Mario
* Collectable system like DK
* Level features from DK (e.g. launcher barrels)
